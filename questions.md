Questions: How would you approach adding automated testing to an existing (web) application with no existing E2E tests? Have you ever had to do this?
Answer: To automate a website, it must be in a stable state. If it is, then doing automation on it, will not be any problem. And before writing automation scripts, I will do the following tasks,
1. Understanding the requirement documentation if available
2. Exploratory testing and writing documentation for features/scenarios to be tested
3. Writing test cases on those features/scenarios
4. Verify those test cases with the QA Lead or the product manager
